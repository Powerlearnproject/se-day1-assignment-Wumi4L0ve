Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer: Software engineering means the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software. This implies that software engineering is all about writing instructions(codes) for computers, building apps,game and websites that makes life easier and at the same time solves real world problems.
The importance of software engineering in the technology industry includes;problem solving, innovation and creativity, making a difference in the aspect of efficiency 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer: 
*software engineering as a art: It means software engineering can only be learned by specific people.this involves the creative and intuitive aspect of software development 
* software engineering transition from art to craft:this is when the area of people who know software designing and coding increases, with the emergence of software engineering as a discipline, focus was shifted from artistic expression of individual programmers to the use of established processes and methodologies to ensure quality and reliability of software systems.
* software engineering transition from craft to an engineering discipline: This transitioning occurs gradually over time as the field matures. focus is now on ensuring a more scientific and systematic approach to software developmental 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer:
✓ planning: This is the ohase to define the project and requirements 
✓ Requirements analysis: gathering of requirements and analyzing requirements gathered 
✓ Design: it is where you create the design framework, application architecture and prototype 
✓ Coding: write the code for the software 
✓ Testing: test the software to ensure functionality and quality 
✓ Deployment: make the software available for use
✓ Maintenance: maintain the software and make improvements 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer: 
waterfall and Agile methodologies are approaches to project management methodologies 
water fall follows a sequential, linear process with distinct phases while Agile uses iterative cycles allowing for a continuous feedback and adaption to changing requirements throughout the development process, making itore flexible and responsive to customers needs.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer:
*A software developer roles and responsibilities include; designing, developing, testing, maintaining software and collaborating with other designer, analysts and stakeholders
*A quality assurance engineer role includes; monitoring and testing all stages of the software development process to identify and report defects, ensuring the final product meets quality standards by designing tests plans, executing test cases, documenting bugs, and collaborating with the development team to deliver a high quality software product.
* Th project manager is responsible for defining project goals, creating detailed project plan, managing resources, tracking progress, communicating with stakeholders, mitigating risks, ensuring quality standards are met, and ultimately delivering the software project on time and within budget.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer: 
Integrated development environments(IDES) are important as they help developer write code faster, more accurately and more efficiently.At the same time it improves codes quality.
Examples of IDES includethe following: 
a) cloud9 IDE
b) Netbeans
c) visual studio
Version control system (VCS) enables efficient tracking of code changes over time, facilitating collaboration between team members by allowing multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts, while also providing the ability to revert to previous versions if errors occur, ultimately improving project progress and code quality.
Examples include;
a) Github
b) Codecommit
c) Bitnucket


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? 
Answer:The major challenges faced by software engineers are; debugging problem, rapid technological change, unclear requirements, teamwork dynamics etc
Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer:The strategies to overcome these challenges are:
a) continuous learning 
b) robust and effective communication practices 
c) thorough requirements gathering and code reviews etc



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Answer
a) Unit testing is the first level of functional testing. it identifies issues early in development ensuring each part of the software functions correctly 
b) Integration testing is a testing types in which different modules or components of a software application are tested together as a group to ensure that they work as intended and are integrated correctly 
c) system testing: it test the entire software application as a whole and ensures that the software meets its functional and mon functional requirements. it is done after integration testing.
d) Acceptance testing:This verifies whether a software application meets the specified acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment. it is usually performed by end-users or stakeholders to ensure that the software meets their requirements and is fir for purpose.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Answer: Prompt engineering is the process of writing instructions for AI models to produce desired outputs. Ot involves selecting words, phrases and formats to help AI interact with users 
Importance of prompt engineering 
a) it allows users to effectively communicate their intent and context to the model
b) There is improved accuracy and relevance
c) it allows for customization and control
d) it enhances users experience 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of vague prompt
Story about a character 
improve prompt can be well detailed as in; " Write a story about a man who must overcome His fear of heights to climb a mountain to safe his family
